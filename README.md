Python 3.13 is removing the  cgi module. I'm bringing it back and making it a pockage.

I'm leaving it as is, but renaming the cgi module cgifu for two reasons:

1. Avoid Namespace Collisions
2. pypi probably won't let me make a cgi pip package
3. So the module can be used with pre 3.13 python and post 3.13 python.
